Patrick Duong and Max Kouzel have helped us on the project during this sprint.
Specifically, they inspire us to think how we can use hidden input to maintain state instead of always wanting to use cookie.
Also, they helped us to debug the databse issue when we have trouble connecting. It turns out there is some sql syntax that we weren't aware of.
